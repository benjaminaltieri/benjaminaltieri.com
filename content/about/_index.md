# Welcome!

Welcome to my small corner of the interwebs. Mostly a placeholder at the moment but feel free to click around!

## My Background

I am a software developer, a dad and life-long learner. I am passionate about music, technology and solving the challenge of global climate change.

I've spent a large portion of my career in the embedded software space, designing systems that collect data from various sensors in the physical world and translate that data into meaningful outputs for the given application. Writing software for embedded devices feels "real" and it's a lot of fun!

Currently I am working in areas related to climate tech, and increasingly looking to branch out in both my knowledge of the challenges and the solutions currently being developed. A specific area of interest is fossil free energy generation and storage technologies and their integration in our modernizing electric grids.
