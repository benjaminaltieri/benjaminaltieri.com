# Welcome!

I'm a software engineer with experience spanning embedded systems, cloud infrastructure, and AI/ML engineering. I enjoy building systems that bridge the physical and digital worlds, and I'm passionate about applying technology to meaningful problems, especially in climate and clean energy.

## Background

I started my career in embedded software, designing sensor systems and firmware for hardware devices. There's something satisfying about writing code that directly interacts with the physical world: reading temperature sensors, controlling actuators, or optimizing power consumption on resource-constrained devices.

Over time, my work expanded into cloud infrastructure and data systems, where I've built platforms for processing and analyzing sensor data at scale. This shift gave me a broader perspective on how embedded devices fit into larger system architectures, from edge computing to cloud analytics.

## Current Work

These days, I'm focused on AI/ML engineering: building and deploying machine learning systems, working with large language models, and exploring AI agent frameworks. I'm particularly interested in how AI can be applied to climate tech challenges, from optimizing energy systems to improving environmental monitoring.

I'm also a dad, lifelong learner, and music enthusiast. Outside of software, you'll find me reading about fossil-free energy technologies, tinkering with side projects, or trying to keep up with my kids.
